## How to Test a Package

The packages contained in this repository are organized under the name `stock_alert`.

To effectively test these packages, it's recommended to navigate to the respective module directory. The modules available are as follows:

- **1. Getting Started with TDD**
- **2. The TDD Cycle**

Once inside the module directory, you can run the following command to execute the unit tests:

```bash
python -m unittest
```

This command will initiate the testing process for the specific module, ensuring that your code is thoroughly validated according to the principles of Test-Driven Development (TDD).
